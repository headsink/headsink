Had almost a whole day rest, I am very fresh.

Intalled [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) with npm after watching [a tutorial on eslint](https://www.jsmastery.pro/lecture-eslint-tips?ck_subscriber_id=1738210642&utm_source=convertkit&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Here%27s+the+video+I+promised%20-%208219947) by [JSM](https://www.jsmastery.pro/)

Installed it globally..
```
npm install -g eslint
```

Next will be installing it in ReactJS or other framework and editing the setting and all...

### How to check your ReactJS version?
```
npm view react version
```

May there be no hiatus away from the Internet, my computer and updates in technology.
### Lesson on git with VSCode
Next time I shouldn't put password when I generate an SSH key which caused the VSCode Git Plugin unable to sync!
### NextJS for Github Pages
I wasn't a good idea, I should try Gatsby instead.

I guess I should be researching on [building a hive blog front end website with nextjs](https://medium.com/@chrisgarrett/building-a-hive-blog-front-end-website-with-nextjs-764b5537284e) and understand the reason on [why someone build a custom hive front end](https://peakd.com/hive-119826/@makerhacks/custom-hive-frontends).
