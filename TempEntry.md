### Installed [Simple-Icons](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons) to Astro
I was easy, just enter the command line inside our Astro directory..
```
npm install simple-icons
```
What kind of magic was there I don't understand yet, but the installer detected Astro and add the dependecies in the package.json file...
```
"dependencies": {
    "simple-icons": "^6.23.0"
  }
```
next will be experimenting simple-icons inside of an Astro component.

### Tutorial to watch
1. [Build a Static Site with Figma & Astro #7 - CSS Setup & Open Props](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBrYC49gYgc&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hZm9NYpd4G-jhoeEk0ls--&index=7)

### New Sites Discovery
1. [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) -- 2255 Free SVG icons for popular brands
2. [HyperUI](https://www.hyperui.dev/) -- Free Open Source Tailwind CSS Components
When I add tailwind to Astro...
```
Astro will make the following changes to your config file:

 ╭ astro.config.mjs ─────────────────────────────╮
 │ import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';  │
 │                                               │
 │ import tailwind from "@astrojs/tailwind";     │
 │                                               │
 │ // https://astro.build/config                 │
 │ export default defineConfig({                 │
 │   integrations: [tailwind()]                  │
 │ });                                           │
 ╰───────────────────────────────────────────────╯

√ Continue? ... yes

  Astro will run the following command:
  If you skip this step, you can always run it yourself later

 ╭───────────────────────────────────╮
 │ yarn add --dev @astrojs/tailwind  │
 ╰───────────────────────────────────╯

√ Continue? ... yes
✔ Installing dependencies...

  Astro will generate a minimal ./tailwind.config.cjs file.

√ Continue? ... yes
  
   success  Added the following integration to your project:
  - @astrojs/tailwind
Done in 86.14s.
```

What is the command??
```
yarn astro add tailwind
```

Should check out [SHIRYO](https://shiryo.com/) P2E Game. For now no gamplay yet, but the starter pack cost around 50 MATIC.

Still deciding whethere to use [Astro](https://astro.build/), Vue, React or combinations of all.

As we can observe from this journal, I am in a scattered brain mode.

Had almost a whole day rest, I am very fresh.

Intalled [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) with npm after watching [a tutorial on eslint](https://www.jsmastery.pro/lecture-eslint-tips?ck_subscriber_id=1738210642&utm_source=convertkit&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Here%27s+the+video+I+promised%20-%208219947) by [JSM](https://www.jsmastery.pro/)

Installed it globally..
```
npm install -g eslint
```

Next will be installing it in ReactJS or other framework and editing the setting and all...

### How to check your ReactJS version?
```
npm view react version
```

May there be no hiatus away from the Internet, my computer and updates in technology.
### Lesson on git with VSCode
Next time I shouldn't put password when I generate an SSH key which caused the VSCode Git Plugin unable to sync!
### NextJS for Github Pages
I wasn't a good idea, I should try Gatsby instead.
