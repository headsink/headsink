I haven't been using git and github for almost half a year. I guess I should include a note about **SSH** and **gh CLI** in Window's PowerShell...

```
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -C "your_email@example.com"
```
After you entered and received message like below
```
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key
```
Make sure to just press enter and not enter any name because it will be saved into the current directory.

Then go to your Github profile setting under **SSH AND PGP KEYS** and under **SSH KEY**, choose **New SSH Key**. Then paste the content in the file named **id_ed25519.pub** inside the default **/.ssh** folder.

So that's it guys. Adios.

<!--
**headsink/headsink** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
